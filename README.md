# My graduated project was about Saudi estates. 
- it is a mobile application designed and developed for android operating system 
to help people that like to get estates without wasting much time.
- now you can search for estate from anywhere without having to go there and you have an ability to contact with the sellers.. 
There are some of the main features of our project:
- You can search by Specifications search or by location with (near me) feature.
- We have Support travel flow data from Google Map.
- The buyers can Evaluate the advertiser.
- The app has a notification feature.
- The user can send report to the administrators about the estates.
- The administrator will receive the reports then he will decide to add him to black list or decline the user's report. 
- After the sale of the estate it will be automatically deleted. 
- The user can make his own list of the favorite and collection estates.
- The application support both Arabic and English languages according to the user's choice.
My role within the project was about written the codes in collaboration with my team, design interfaces with description, 
development method, ERD diagram, activity diagram and the questionnaire.
